# DataVis

Just a bunch of random visualizations of data I collect from the web that seems interesting and useful to me.


# 1. Earthquakes in Turkey (2010-2019)

All data shown are sorted in Mw (moment magnitude) order. The size of the dataplot on the map directly corresponds to the size of the Mw.

# 2. TBA
